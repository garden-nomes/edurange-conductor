Description: This scenario uses an ELF binary format infection technique (written
  by Nick Stephens https://github.com/NickStephens/elfit) to insert malicious instructinos
  into several common binary commands. Students can use tools like readelf, objdump,
  strace, and gdb to determine how each binary is infected.
Instructions: Have the students login to the Player_Instance. All files on Player_instance
  in /usr/special/bin are infected with a unique infection that the students should
  identify.
